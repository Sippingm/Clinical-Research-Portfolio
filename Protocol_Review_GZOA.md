# Protocol Review – GZOA Part B (Phase I, NAFLD Study)  

**Study Design**: Single-ascending and repeated subcutaneous dose study in NAFLD patients with PNPLA3 I148M genotype.  

**Objectives**:  
- Primary: Evaluate safety, tolerability, PK/PD of LYXXXXXX.  
- Secondary: Explore biomarkers and genotype-drug interactions.  

**Endpoints**:  
- Safety: Adverse events, labs, vitals, ECG.  
- PK: Cmax, Tmax, AUC, half-life.  
- PD: Biomarker response (ALT, AST, liver stiffness).  

**Key Inclusion Criteria**:  
- Age 18–65, confirmed NAFLD, PNPLA3 genotype positive.  

**Key Exclusion Criteria**:  
- History of decompensated liver disease, concurrent investigational agents, pregnancy.  

**Operational Notes**:  
- Target N = 13 subjects across 6 sites.  
- Enrollment period: 9 months.  
- SIV before activation.  

**Takeaway**: Protocol is feasible but requires strong site pre-screening for PNPLA3 genotype to avoid screen failures.
